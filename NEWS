Notes for revision 0.3.6-devel.0
--------------------------------

* Package infrastructure development.

* This  release  does  *not*  use "pkg-config"  anymore  to  locate  the
  installed re2  package: the  upstream re2 package  does not  install a
  data file for re2 when built with the CMake stuff.


Notes for revision 0.3.5
------------------------

* Fixed missing dependency in pkg-config script.


Notes for revision 0.3.4
------------------------

* Some   typo   fixes   and   implementation   of   the   new   function
  "cre2_find_named_capturing_groups()".
